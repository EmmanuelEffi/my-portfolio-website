Hi, I'm Emmanuel. I'm a beginner in web development. I currently code in HTML5 and CSS3.
This is a dummy portfolio website I coded using pure HTML5 and CSS3.
It does'nt contain any real photos of real life portfolios.
I'm working on projects so I can improve and get used to the git and web development workflow.

Let me know what you think!
